# Building a Financial Research Agent with AgentUp

## Overview

Financial markets generate an overwhelming amount of information every day. From earnings reports and analyst upgrades to regulatory filings and macroeconomic indicators, staying on top of market developments requires constant vigilance and research. This tutorial demonstrates how to build an AI-powered financial research agent that can autonomously gather, analyze, and organize market intelligence using the AgentUp framework.

Our financial research agent combines web search capabilities with local file operations to perform comprehensive market analysis. Rather than simply answering questions, it conducts multi-step research processes, refines its analysis through iterations, and saves structured reports for future reference. The agent uses AgentUp's plugin architecture to seamlessly integrate external data sources with local file management, creating a complete research workflow.

What makes this implementation particularly powerful is its use of streaming responses, allowing you to watch the research process unfold in real-time. Instead of waiting for a final answer, you can observe how the agent formulates research strategies, discovers new information, and builds comprehensive analysis step by step.


## Why This Approach Matters

Traditional financial research tools often operate in isolation. You might use one service for market data, another for news aggregation, and yet another for report generation. This fragmented approach leads to context switching, data silos, and missed connections between different pieces of information.

Our agent solves these problems by creating a unified research workflow. When you ask about Tesla's recent performance, for example, the agent doesn't just search for current stock prices. It conducts a comprehensive analysis that might include recent earnings data, analyst sentiment, regulatory developments, competitive landscape analysis, and technical indicators. Each piece of information builds upon the previous findings, creating a comprehensive picture that would take a human analyst hours to assemble.

The iterative nature of the research process is crucial. After gathering initial information, the agent reflects on what it has learned and identifies gaps in its understanding. It then conducts additional searches to fill these gaps, gradually building a more complete and nuanced analysis. This mirrors how experienced financial analysts approach complex research questions.

## Real-World Applications

Consider a portfolio manager who needs to evaluate a potential investment in renewable energy stocks. Instead of spending hours manually researching different companies, policy developments, and market trends, they can task the agent with conducting comprehensive research. The agent might begin by searching for recent news about renewable energy policies, then pivot to analyzing specific company performance metrics, before concluding with an assessment of broader market sentiment and regulatory risks.

Investment committees often need rapid analysis of breaking news or sudden market movements. When a major tech company announces an acquisition, the agent can quickly research both companies involved, analyze the strategic rationale, assess market reaction, and compile findings into a structured report that decision-makers can review immediately.

Research analysts working on sector reports can use the agent to gather baseline information across multiple companies and markets. Rather than starting from scratch, they can leverage the agent's ability to systematically collect and organize information, allowing them to focus their human expertise on higher-level analysis and strategic insights.

## Technical Architecture

The agent is built on AgentUp's plugin system, which provides a clean separation of concerns between different capabilities. The `agentup_systools` plugin handles all local file operations, including reading existing research files, creating new reports, and organizing data into directory structures. Meanwhile, the `agentup_brave` plugin manages web search functionality, providing access to real-time financial information from authoritative sources.

This plugin architecture means you can easily extend the agent's capabilities. Need to add direct API access to financial data providers? Simply integrate a new plugin without modifying the core agent logic. Want to include sentiment analysis of social media data? Add another plugin to the configuration. The modular approach ensures that each component can be developed, tested, and maintained independently.

Security is handled through AgentUp's scope-based authorization system. Each plugin capability requires specific permissions, and the agent's API key must include the necessary scopes to access those capabilities. For example, web search operations require the `api:read` scope, while file writing operations require `files:write` permissions. This fine-grained control ensures that agents only have access to the capabilities they actually need.

## Streaming and Real-Time Feedback

One of the most compelling aspects of this implementation is its use of streaming responses. Traditional chatbots and AI assistants often leave users waiting for long periods while processing complex requests. This creates anxiety about whether the system is working and provides no insight into the reasoning process.

Our streaming implementation solves this by providing continuous feedback as the research unfolds. You can watch the agent formulate its research strategy, see search queries as they're executed, observe how information is gathered and synthesized, and understand the logical progression from initial inquiry to final conclusions.

For example, when researching Bitcoin price trends, you might see the agent start with broad market overview searches, then narrow down to specific technical analysis, followed by regulatory news gathering, and finally synthesis into a comprehensive market assessment. Each step is visible as it happens, creating transparency and building confidence in the agent's analytical process.

This streaming approach is particularly valuable for complex financial analysis where the research path isn't predetermined. Financial markets are influenced by countless interconnected factors, and effective research often requires following unexpected leads and making connections between seemingly unrelated developments.

## Getting Started

To begin using the financial research agent, you'll need API keys for both Brave Search and OpenAI. Brave Search provides access to real-time web information, while OpenAI powers the agent's reasoning and analysis capabilities. Once you have these keys, setting up the environment is straightforward:

```bash
# Install required dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Configure your API keys
export BRAVE_API_KEY="your-brave-api-key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-openai-api-key"

# Start the agent server
agentup run --config agentup.yml
```

The agent can be used in several ways depending on your preferences and workflow. The Jupyter notebook provides an interactive environment where you can experiment with different research topics and see streaming responses in real-time. This is ideal for learning how the agent works and testing different types of financial research queries.

For production use cases, the standalone Python application offers command-line access with batch processing capabilities. You can research multiple topics simultaneously, save results to organized file structures, and integrate the agent into existing workflows and automation systems.

## Example Research Sessions

To illustrate the agent's capabilities, let's walk through a typical research session. Suppose you want to understand the recent performance of major technology stocks and their outlook for the remainder of the year.

You might start with a query like "Analyze the Q3 2024 performance of major tech stocks including Apple, Microsoft, Google, and Amazon, and assess their prospects for Q4." The agent would begin by searching for recent earnings reports and analyst commentary for each company.

During the first iteration, the agent discovers that Apple had mixed results with strong iPhone sales but weakness in China, Microsoft continues to benefit from cloud growth, Google faces regulatory pressures but maintains search dominance, and Amazon's AWS division is showing strong momentum. However, this initial research reveals gaps in understanding about broader market sentiment and sector-wide trends.

In subsequent iterations, the agent might research broader technology sector ETF performance, analyze institutional investor positioning, investigate regulatory developments affecting tech companies, and assess macroeconomic factors like interest rates and consumer spending that could impact the sector.

The final research report would synthesize all of these findings into a comprehensive analysis that covers individual company performance, sector-wide trends, regulatory considerations, and forward-looking risk factors. This report would be automatically saved to the research_data directory with appropriate timestamps and clear organization.

## Advanced Features and Customization

The agent's system prompt can be easily customized for different types of financial analysis. The current configuration focuses on general market research, but you could adapt it for specialized areas like cryptocurrency analysis, options trading research, or ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) investing.

For cryptocurrency research, you might emphasize technical analysis, on-chain metrics, regulatory developments, and market sentiment indicators. An ESG-focused agent might prioritize sustainability reports, social impact assessments, and governance quality metrics. The flexible prompt system allows you to create specialized agents while maintaining the same underlying architecture and capabilities.

Error handling and resilience are built into the agent's design. If a web search fails or returns insufficient information, the agent can adapt its strategy and try alternative approaches. Rate limiting is handled gracefully, with the agent automatically pacing its requests to stay within API limits while maintaining research momentum.

The file organization system creates structured directories for different types of research, making it easy to build up a knowledge base over time. Research reports include timestamps, source citations, and clear formatting that makes them useful for both immediate decision-making and future reference.


## Extending and Customizing

The agent's modular architecture makes it easy to extend and customize for specific use cases. You might add new plugins for accessing specialized financial data sources, integrate with existing portfolio management systems, or create custom analysis modules for specific asset classes or trading strategies.

Custom system prompts can be created to specialize the agent for different types of financial analysis. A quantitative trading agent might emphasize technical indicators and statistical analysis, while a fundamental analysis agent might focus more heavily on company financials and industry trends.

The streaming architecture can be extended to support real-time dashboards or integration with existing workflow tools. You could build web interfaces that display research progress in real-time, or integrate with team communication tools to provide automatic updates on ongoing research projects.
